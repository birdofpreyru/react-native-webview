This Example App relies on the source code of `react-native-webview` library in
the parent folder, and it is set up in the same way as the library template
created by [create-react-native-library] sets up its example.

To run it do the following commands in the parent (library codebase root) folder:
```sh
yarn # Installs all necessary dependencies for the library and example app.

yarn example start # Starts Metro server for the example app.

yarn example android # Deploys development build of the example app to Android device / simulator.
```
