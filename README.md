**NOTE:** _This is a customized fork of the upstream
[react-native-webview](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-webview)
library. It follows latest upstream releases, and applies on top of them selected
fixes and PRs faster that take ages to be merged in into the upstream._

To use this for remove the original `react-native-webview` dependency from
your `package.json`, then install the forked package as
```shell
npm install --save @dr.pogodin/react-native-webview
```
then replace `react-native-webview` imports in your TypeScript code by
`@dr.pogodin/react-native-webview` imports.

**Current Differences from the Upstream:**
- [Upstream issue #3014](https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview/issues/3014)
  &mdash; **Android:** Accept the input focus only when a touch on WebView hits
  a focusable (text input) element inside the WebView's content.
- [Upstream issue #3289](https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview/issues/3289)
  / [Upstream PR #3290](https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview/pull/3290)
  &mdash; **Android:** Trigger `onError` callback on asset loading errors.
- [Upstream issue #3317](https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview/issues/3317)
  / [Upstream PR #3318](https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview/pull/3318) &mdash; **Android, iOS, macOS** Support of `window.print()` function.

**React Native WebView** is a community-maintained WebView component for React Native. It is intended to be a replacement for the built-in WebView (which was [removed from core](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/pull/3)).

### Maintainers

**Many thanks to these companies** for providing us with time to work on open source.  
Please note that maintainers spend a lot of free time working on this too so feel free to sponsor them, **it really makes a difference.**

Windows and macOS are managed by Microsoft, notably:

- [Chiara Mooney](https://github.com/chiaramooney) from [React Native for Windows @ Microsoft](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/)

Shout-out to [Jamon Holmgren](https://github.com/jamonholmgren) from [Infinite Red](https://infinite.red) for helping a lot with the repo when he had more available time.

### Disclaimer

Maintaining WebView is very complex because it is often used for many different use cases (rendering SVGs, PDFs, login flows, and much more). We also support many platforms and both architectures of react-native.

Since WebView was extracted from the React Native core, nearly 500 pull requests have been merged.  
Considering that we have limited time, issues will mostly serve as a discussion place for the community, while **we will prioritize reviewing and merging pull requests.** 

### Platform compatibility

This project is compatible with **iOS**,  **Android**, **Windows** and **macOS**.  
This project supports both **the old** (paper) **and the new architecture** (fabric).  
This project is compatible with [expo](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/webview/).

### Getting Started

Read our [Getting Started Guide](docs/Getting-Started.md). If any step seems unclear, please create a pull request.

### Versioning

This project follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). We do not hesitate to release breaking changes but they will be in a major version.

### Usage

Import the `WebView` component from `react-native-webview` and use it like so:

```tsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { WebView } from 'react-native-webview';

// ...
const MyWebComponent = () => {
  return <WebView source={{ uri: 'https://reactnative.dev/' }} style={{ flex: 1 }} />;
}
```

For more, read the [API Reference](./docs/Reference.md) and [Guide](./docs/Guide.md). If you're interested in contributing, check out the [Contributing Guide](./docs/Contributing.md).

### Common issues

- If you're getting `Invariant Violation: Native component for "RNCWebView does not exist"` it likely means you forgot to run `react-native link` or there was some error with the linking process
- If you encounter a build error during the task `:app:mergeDexRelease`, you need to enable multidex support in `android/app/build.gradle` as discussed in [this issue](https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview/issues/1344#issuecomment-650544648)
